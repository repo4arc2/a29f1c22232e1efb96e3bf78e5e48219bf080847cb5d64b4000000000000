1
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:14,020
{\an8}洛基
第一季 第四集

2
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:14,470
{\pos(190.2,132)}前情提要

3
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:35,770
{\an8}时间变异管理局
时时刻刻  永永远远

4
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:30,470
{\an8}时间剧院47号

5
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:02,640
{\an8}全抓到了吗  核实是否彻底删除

6
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:44,220
{\an8}罗克斯卡特

7
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:16,100
{\an8}正在搜索

8
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,680
{\an8}正在提取  追踪者C20  正在加载数据库  正在打开档案

9
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:23,270
{\an8}追踪者C20  状态  已死亡

10
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,680
{\an8}任务信息

11
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:33,390
{\an8}已找到卷宗  任务汇报  机密  阿拉巴马圣所山  罗克斯卡特

12
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:06,190
所以你是时管局勇敢尽心的员工之一吗
So, you're part of the TVA's courageous and dedicated workforce?

13
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,030
对
Yes.

14
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:09,240
你们是时间守护者创造的
You were created by the Time-Keepers?

15
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,200
对
Correct.

16
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,700
你不是唯一为我工作的分析师
You're not the only analyst working for me.

17
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:19,190
但你觉得我是你最喜欢的那个吗
But, would you say, maybe, I'm your favorite one?

18
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,900
魅术是个聪明的小把戏
Enchantment is a clever trick.

19
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,490
我必须用他们的记忆创建出一个幻觉
I have to create a fantasy from their memories.

20
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,820
时管局的那个年轻士兵
That young soldier from the TVA,

21
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:27,820
她曾经只是地球上的一个普通人
she was just a regular person on Earth.

22
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:34,690
时空器上存储的所有天启
Of all of the apocalypses saved on that TemPad,

23
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:35,780
这个是最糟的
this is the worst!

24
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:37,280
这里无人生还
No one makes it off here!

25
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,400
他们还有多久
How long do we have?

26
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,610
12小时左右
Twelve hours or so.

27
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:41,740
这里的情况只会更糟
Things down here are only gonna get worse.

28
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,070
敬世界末日
To the end of the world.

29
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,030
火龙呼啸着飞向王宫
Dragon swoops towards the palace,

30
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:02,030
女武神飞过来  击败了火龙  拯救了阿斯加德
the Valkyrie flies over, defeats the dragon, and saves Asgard.

31
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,650
她就是时间异体
There's our Variant.

32
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,440
我仅代表时间守护者
On the authority of the Time-Keepers,

33
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:11,490
以违反神圣时间线的罪名逮捕你
I hereby arrest you for crimes against the Sacred Timeline.

34
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:13,490
重置
Reset it.

35
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:14,570
等等
Wait!

36
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,400
不
No! No!

37
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,530
帮帮他
Help him!

38
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:06,700
下一案
Next case!

39
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:12,360
-下一案  -就是她
- Next case! - Right here!

40
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,070
他们说什么了  你还好吗
What'd they say? Are you okay?

41
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,900
不  莫比乌斯  我不好
No, no, Mobius. I'm not.

42
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,610
在最好的情况下
Under the best of circumstances,

43
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,740
面见时间守护者也让人不舒服
it's jarring to stand before the Time-Keepers.

44
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,780
这可不是最好的情况
And this is not the best of circumstances.

45
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,280
他们又不能怪你
Yeah, but they can't blame you.

46
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,650
他们能  他们是怪我
They can and do.

47
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:34,780
时间异体都冲进来了
The Variant was right here.

48
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,610
万一她找上了时间守护者呢
What if she got to the Time-Keepers?

49
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:39,570
是啊  但她没有
I know. But she didn't.

50
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,450
对  但她跑了
No. But she got away.

51
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:42,360
还有那个
Along with the Variant

52
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,530
我允许你带进来的时间异体
that I got you permission to bring in here.

53
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,440
你知道稳定时间线
Do you have any idea how impossible it is

54
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:51,150
有多难办到吗
to keep the timeline stable?

55
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,530
只有时间守护者避免我们
The Time-Keepers are all that stand

56
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:55,320
遭遇绝对灾难
between us and full-scale calamity.

57
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,150
我很庆幸我们还有他们
And I'm glad they're on our side.

58
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,690
但如果他们想让我找到洛基和时间异体
But if they want me to find Loki and the Variant,

59
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,030
我需要跟追踪者C20谈谈
I need access to Hunter C-20.

60
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:03,440
抱歉  但那不可能
I'm sorry, but that's impossible.

61
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:07,320
我们找到她时  她不断念叨着"是真的"
Look, when we found her, she kept saying, "It's real. It's real."

62
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,320
一遍遍地重复  我需要搞清楚那什么意思
Over and over. I need to find out what that meant

63
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,570
以及她跟时间异体在一起时  还看到了什么
and what else she saw when she was with the Variant.

64
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:15,650
我知道有规章  但她可能知道信息
Look, I know there's protocol, but she could have information...

65
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:17,570
她死了  莫比乌斯
She's dead, Mobius!

66
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:20,320
什么  怎么回事
What? How?

67
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:26,400
时间异体魅惑了C20
The Variant, she enchanted C-20,

68
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,110
搅乱了她的脑子
scrambled her mind.

69
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:35,650
我不懂  她看上去没事  挺好的
I don't get it. She seemed okay. She seemed fine.

70
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,110
乍看是没事
At first, yes.

71
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,860
但她回来时  都几乎无法言语了
But by the time she got in here, she could barely speak.

72
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,360
之后更是急转直下
The decline was steeper after that.

73
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,530
-我不知道  -没人知道
- I didn't know. What... - Nobody does.

74
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:49,740
我们不希望大家恐慌
We don't want people to panic.

75
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,780
你可以保密吗
Can I trust you to keep that between us?

76
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,200
当然了
Of course. Yes.

77
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,110
对不起
I'm sorry.

78
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:01,780
只要时间异体还在逃
Every moment those Variants are out there,

79
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,280
我们就都有危险
we're all in danger.

80
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,030
找到他们
Find them!

81
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:56,900
对不起
I'm sorry.

82
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,570
我还记得阿斯加德
I remember Asgard.

83
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:09,740
记得不多  但我记得
Not much, but I remember.

84
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:14,990
我的家  我的族人  我的生活
My home, my people, my life.

85
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:24,820
宇宙想挣脱束缚  于是就呈现出了混乱
The universe wants to break free, so it manifests chaos.

86
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,740
就像我生来就是恶作剧女神
Like me being born the Goddess of Mischief.

87
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,690
一旦这导致了与神圣时间线
And as soon as that created a big enough detour

88
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,820
足够大的偏离
from the Sacred Timeline,

89
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:39,650
时管局就出现  抹除了我的现实
the TVA showed up, erased my reality,

90
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:40,780
还抓走了我
and took me prisoner.

91
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,320
我当时还是孩子
I was just a child.

92
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,110
我逃了
I escaped.

93
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,450
偷了个时空器  我逃窜了很久
Stole a TemPad and I ran for a long, long time,

94
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,110
这滋味很不好受
which really sucked.

95
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:00,950
我每到一个地方  一个时间  都会导致关联事件
Everywhere and every-when I went, it caused a nexus event.

96
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,360
就像燃起了烟雾信号弹
Sent up a smoke flare.

97
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:07,860
因为我本不该存在
Because I'm not supposed to exist.

98
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,820
直到我最终想到了该藏在哪
Until, eventually, I figured out where to hide.

99
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:15,240
我就在那里长大
And so that's where I grew up,

100
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,150
上千个世界的末日
the ends of a thousand worlds.

101
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,070
现在
Now...

102
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:24,990
我也要在末日里死去
...that's where I'll die.

103
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,240
什么都没有  长官
There's nothing, sir.

104
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,780
哪怕提高了关联事件的阈值吗
Even with the magnified nexus threshold?

105
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,030
按现在的标准  哪怕有人
That one should be setting off alarms

106
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,900
踩错了树叶也该发出警报
if somebody steps on the wrong leaf.

107
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,030
不管他们在哪  恐怕没有任何东西幸存
Wherever they are, I'm not sure anything survives.

108
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,860
嗯  别低估他们
Yeah. Don't underestimate them.

109
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,440
你在罗克斯卡特看到什么了吗
You see anything down at Roxxcart?

110
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:46,530
他们不见了
They're gone.

111
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,820
穿越时间  谋划着下次屠杀
Leaping across time, plotting their next massacre.

112
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:55,450
C20有消息吗
Any news on C-20?

113
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:57,740
没有
No.

114
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,200
我们得找到他们
We need to find them.

115
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:03,700
我们会找到的
We will.

116
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,450
快了
Not long now.

117
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,360
你觉得洛基的决定性特征
Do you think that what makes a Loki a Loki

118
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:39,530
是不是我们命中注定要输
is the fact that we're destined to lose?

119
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:41,110
不是
No.

120
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,070
我们可能会输
We may lose.

121
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,700
有时输得很惨
Sometimes painfully.

122
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,280
但我们不会死
But we don't die.

123
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,570
我们总能活下来
We survive.

124
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:54,860
你就活了下来
I mean, you did.

125
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,940
时管局抓住你时  你还是孩子
You were just a child when the TVA took you,

126
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:58,850
但你差点扳倒了
but you nearly took down 

127
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:01,940
自称主宰时间秩序的组织
the organization that claims to govern the order of time.

128
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,070
那是你自己办到的
You did it on your own.

129
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:05,490
你把他们耍得团团转  你好厉害
You ran rings around them. You're amazing!

130
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:12,990
有发现
We've got something.

131
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,200
时间锁定
Temporal lock.

132
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:41,610
好吧  那可不叫踩错了树叶
Okay, that's not someone stepping on the wrong leaf.

133
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:43,740
你见过这样的分支吗
You ever seen a branch like that?

134
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:45,610
没有
No.

135
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:20,070
-怎么样  -什么怎么样
- Well? - Well, what?

136
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:22,110
我知道你肯定有特想说的骚话
I know you got some quip you're dyin' to say.

137
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:24,240
我没什么骚话  我对你没什么好说的
I don't have a quip. I've got nothing to say.

138
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,280
得了
Come on.

139
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,280
对了  该给我配备同样多的安保人员
By the way, I should have an equal amount of security.

140
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,360
这简直是羞辱
This is insulting!

141
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,900
你就是忍不住
You just can't help yourself.

142
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,650
-你背叛了我  -是你背叛了我
- You betrayed me! - You betrayed me!

143
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,320
-别那么幼稚了  -你才幼稚
- Grow up! - You grow up.

144
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,610
我意识到
You know, it occurred to me that

145
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,780
你才不是恶作剧之神
you're not really the God of Mischief.

146
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,780
来了
Oh, here it comes.

147
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:42,990
庸俗之人的庸俗嘲讽
The folksy, dopey insult from the folksy dope.

148
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:46,150
我是什么  自我破坏之神吗
What am I? The God of Self-Sabotage, yeah?

149
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,280
背后捅刀之神吗
The God of Back-Stabbing?

150
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,150
就是个混蛋  和猪队友
Just kind of an asshole and a bad friend.

151
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:54,110
嗯  好好想想吧  好了  就绪
Yeah, chew on that for a little bit. All right. It's ready.

152
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:55,860
这是什么
What is this?

153
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:56,820
你会知道的
You'll see.

154
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,820
-莫比乌斯  -行了
- Mobius! - Okay. No, no, no, let him,

155
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:03,110
让走投无路的恶作剧者再出最后一招吧  有请
one last desperate trick from the desperate trickster. Go ahead.

156
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:06,820
时管局在骗你
The TVA is lying to you.

157
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,490
把他丢进去
Put him in.

158
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:12,900
不
No.

159
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:18,320
什么
What?

160
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:23,740
不是吧
Seriously?

161
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,070
你
You.

162
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:31,610
希芙
Sif.

163
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:34,900
你个狡猾  懦弱  可悲的蠕虫
You conniving, craven, pathetic worm.

164
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:37,150
-这是你干的  -什么
- You did this. - What?

165
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:42,450
希望你知道你活该孤独一人  而且你会永远孤独
I hope you know you deserve to be alone and you always will be.

166
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:43,240
好吧
All right.

167
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:46,490
坏记忆监狱吗  真有趣
A bad memory prison? How quaint.

168
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,250
好个惩罚
Some punishment!

169
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,650
我清楚地记得我之后做了什么
I remember exactly what I did after that.

170
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,860
我去泡了个热水澡
I went and had a nice, hot bath

171
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:07,900
喝了杯酒  然后再没想过这事
and a glass of wine, and I never thought about it again,

172
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,450
因为这不过是玩玩
because it was just a bit of fun.

173
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:14,860
你
You.

174
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:19,490
你个狡猾  懦弱  可悲的蠕虫  这是你干的
You conniving, craven, pathetic worm. You did this.

175
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:20,150
等等
Hang on.

176
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,440
希望你知道你活该孤独一人  而且你会永远孤独
I hope you know you deserve to be alone and you always will be.

177
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:25,110
等等
Just...

178
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:39,280
时间循环  真棒
Time loops. How lovely.

179
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:42,990
你
You.

180
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:46,150
你个狡猾  懦弱  可悲的蠕虫
You conniving, craven, pathetic worm.

181
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:48,320
好吧  希芙  等等
Okay. Okay, Sif. Hang on.

182
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:52,190
不  你给我听着  你活该孤独一人
No, you hear this. You deserve to be alone...

183
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,650
而且我会永远孤独  我知道了
And I always will be. All right, I get it.

184
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:57,530
听着  你是一段记忆的重塑
Listen. You are a reconstruction of a past event

185
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:00,860
由控制所有时间的组织创造
created by the organization that controls all of time.

186
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,780
所以你得信任我  帮我逃跑  好吗
So you need to trust me and you need to help me escape. Yeah?

187
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,780
很好
Okay, good.

188
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:17,860
可悲
Pathetic.

189
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:28,740
你不是该去审讯洛基时间异体吗
Shouldn't you be interrogating the Loki Variant?

190
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,440
他在时间囚室里学乖呢
He's softening in the Time Cell,

191
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:31,610
但趁他反思时
but while he marinates,

192
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:33,990
我想审审另一个时间异体
I thought maybe I'd interview the other Variant.

193
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:37,320
不  审你的洛基就好
Oh, no. Just stick with your Loki

194
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:39,150
搞清楚那次关联峰值是怎么回事
and figure out what that nexus spike was.

195
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,940
我知道  但我觉得如果同时审他们俩
I know, but I think I can get there faster

196
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:42,280
能更快达到效果
if I work 'em both together.

197
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,530
你不是说我们都有各自的角色  而我...
Remeber, you said we have a part to play, and the part I play...

198
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:48,150
绝对不行  她太危险了
Absolutely not. She's just too dangerous.

199
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:50,940
太危险  拜托  萝雯娜  这是我的工作
Too dangerous? Come on, Ravonna. This is what I do.

200
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,280
而这是我的工作
And this is what I do.

201
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:55,070
谁都不许跟那个时间异体说话
Nobody speaks with that Variant.

202
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:00,940
如果存在幕后主使  我觉得那人不是洛基
I mean, if there's a mastermind here, I don't think it's Loki.

203
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:01,860
很好
Good.

204
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,280
那让他开口应该更容易了
Then he should be the easiest to break.

205
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:08,360
审你的洛基  搞清楚关联峰值怎么来的
Work your Loki and figure out what caused that spike.

206
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,110
时间守护者盯着你呢  莫比乌斯
Time-Keepers are watching, Mobius.

207
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:13,530
他们总盯着我们  "审你的洛基"
They're always watching. "Work your Loki, work your Loki."

208
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:15,200
我该拿这当祷告语
That ought to be my mantra.

209
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:20,320
你没事吧
You all right?

210
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:22,950
她在里面吗
Is she in there?

211
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,030
他们真能闹腾  是吧
They don't go gently, do they?

212
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:30,400
你不是该去审你的时间异体跟班吗
Aren't you supposed to be interrogating your Variant pet?

213
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,740
就是舒展下腿脚
Just stretching my legs.

214
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:36,070
我们抓到过克里人  泰坦  吸血鬼
You know, we brought in Kree, Titans, vampires.

215
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:39,690
怎么两个孤儿半神那么大麻烦
Why is it the two orphan demigods are such a pain in the ass?

216
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,150
还是你说要再找个来
And yet it was your idea to bring in another one.

217
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,740
很高兴这点子能被归功给我
I'm happy to share credit for that idea.

218
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,700
莫比乌斯
Mobius?

219
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,240
你在里面时  洛基跟你说什么了吗
Did Loki say anything while you were in there?

220
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,150
嗯  他说时管局在对我撒谎
Yeah. He said the TVA is lying to me.

221
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:57,990
怎么了
Why?

222
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,200
我只是在尽职
Just doing my job.

223
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:10,940
你
You.

224
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:14,210
你个狡猾  懦弱
You conniving, craven...

225
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:15,490
-希芙  -可悲的蠕虫
- Sif. Sif. - ...pathetic worm.

226
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:19,290
求你了  别再来了  我求你了
Please, please, no more. Please, I beg you.

227
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:23,980
我是个大烂人  我知道  我是
I'm a horrible person. I get it. I really am.

228
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:28,130
我剪了你的头发  因为我觉得那好玩
I cut off your hair because I thought it'd be funny.

229
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,720
但不好玩
And it's not.

230
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,290
我渴望关注
I crave attention...

231
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:41,930
因为我...
because I'm...

232
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:45,670
我是个自恋狂
I'm a... I'm a narcissist.

233
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,190
我想那是
And I suppose it's...

234
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,300
因为我害怕孤独
It's because I'm scared of being alone.

235
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:21,920
你就是孤独一人  而且你会永远孤独
You are alone and you always will be.

236
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,380
好吧  洛基
Okay, Loki.

237
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,240
你愿意开口了吗
You ready to talk?

238
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,040
厉害的科技
Fancy technology.

239
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:58,200
令人生畏的审讯技巧
Threatening interrogation tactics.

240
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,410
看来你和我  也进入了一个循环
Seems you and I are in a loop of our own.

241
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:05,140
那之后可发生了不少事呢
Well, there's been a lot of water under the bridge since then.

242
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,250
是啊
Certainly has.

243
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,070
好  你说时管局在对我撒谎  请讲吧
Okay, you said the TVA is lying to me. Go ahead.

244
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,750
还是说那只是蟑螂的生存本能在发挥作用
Or is that just a cockroach's survival mechanism kicking in?

245
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,350
放我出去  别再伤害我了  我就告诉你
Let me out of this place, stop beating me up, and I'll tell you.

246
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,800
是蟑螂  好吧
Cockroach. Got it.

247
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:20,170
你为时间异体做事有多久了
How long have you been working for the Variant?

248
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:23,060
我  为她做事  拜托
Me? Working for her? Please.

249
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,150
好吧  如果你不是在为时间异体做事
Okay. If you're not working for the Variant,

250
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:26,980
那算什么  你们是搭档吗
what is it? You're partners?

251
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:28,930
绝对不是
Absolutely not.

252
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:34,250
她难搞又烦人
She's difficult and irritating,

253
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,470
她还总想打我
and she tries to hit me all the time.

254
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:40,600
不  不是搭档
No. Not partners, no.

255
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,570
我想你也不会找搭档
Yeah, I guess you don't do partners.

256
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:44,440
当然  除非那对你有利
Unless, of course, it benefits you,

257
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,690
而且你打算之后什么时候背叛那人
and you intend to betray them at some point.

258
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:49,340
那不过是达成目的的手段  莫比乌斯
It was a means to an end, Mobius.

259
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:51,070
欢迎来到真实世界
Welcome to the real world.

260
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,450
在现实里  我们为达成目的  彼此厮杀
Down there, we're awful to one another to get what we want.

261
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:56,520
我现在还要听一位王子告诉我现实世界什么样吗
Now I gotta have a prince tell me how the real world works?

262
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,700
你就告诉我
Why don't you just tell me

263
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:00,250
是什么导致了拉曼蒂斯上的关联事件
what caused the nexus event on Lamentis?

264
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,530
我再说一次
Let me say this again.

265
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:03,410
我不会告诉你的
I'm not going to tell you

266
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:06,890
不然你调头就会删掉我
just so you can turn around immediately afterwards and prune me.

267
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:09,120
那看来我们走到死胡同里了
I guess we've reached a dead end then.

268
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,180
好啊  那就这样吧
Okay, it's over.

269
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,720
我会想念这样的对话
I'm going to miss these little tete-a-tetes.

270
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,500
我也是
Me, too.

271
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:18,700
你喜欢跳棋  老莫比乌斯喜欢国际象棋
One guy playing checkers, you, old Mobius playing chess,

272
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:23,380
但行啊  代我向希芙女士问好
but, yeah, give my regards to Lady Sif.

273
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,240
什么  别  不要
What... No. What? No, no, no.

274
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:29,400
别这样  等等
Please, not... Well, just wait, wait, wait.

275
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:31,140
什么
Yeah?

276
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:37,670
当然都是我操纵的
Of course it was me pulling the strings all along.

277
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:43,260
她很久以前来阿斯加德找过我
She came to me on Asgard a long time ago

278
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:47,150
然后她带我去了她的一个天启
and then she took me to one of her apocalypses

279
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,760
我们就是在那里一起制定了计划
and that's where we hatched our plan together.

280
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,400
什么计划
Which is?

281
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:54,960
进展得多顺利  谢谢
Coming along very nicely, thank you.

282
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,040
那时间异体呢
And the Variant?

283
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:59,070
无所谓  她不过是个棋子
Doesn't matter. She's a pawn.

284
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,020
要发生很大的事了
Something very, very big is gonna happen.

285
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:05,580
到时候  我就丢掉她
And when it does, I'll dispose of her.

286
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,980
那我们替你省了麻烦了
Well, we saved you the trouble there.

287
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,710
她已经被删除了
She's already been pruned.

288
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,750
-假如我放了你  -等等
- So assume I do set you free. - Hang on, wait.

289
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:17,210
-你说什么  -什么  假如我放了你
- What'd you just say? - What? Assume I do set you free.

290
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:19,120
时间异体  她死了吗
The Variant. She's gone?

291
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:22,400
对  她还干掉了我们两个人
Yeah. Not before she took out two of ours.

292
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,420
她本来要被关进时间囚室  但她挣脱了
Yeah, she was going to her Time Cell, broke free.

293
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:29,000
追踪者B15及时出手  删了她
Hunter B-15 stepped in, popped her.

294
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:32,550
你最好给追踪者B15写封感谢信
So you might want to fire off a thank you note to Hunter B-15,

295
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:35,990
因为看来你现在是更厉害的洛基了
because it looks like you're the superior Loki.

296
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,970
我本会压她的  但赌局就这么难料
I would've bet on her, but that's what makes a horse race.

297
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,560
可算摆脱了
Good riddance.

298
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:57,270
-有什么好笑的  -拜托
- What's so funny? - Come on.

299
00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:00,040
看看你的眼神  你喜欢她
Look at your eyes. You like her.

300
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:03,040
-什么  -你喜欢她  她喜欢你吗
- What? - You like her. Does she like you?

301
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,140
-她被删了吗  -难怪你不懂拉曼蒂斯上的
- Was she pruned? - No wonder you have no clue

302
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,960
关联事件是怎么造成的
what caused the nexus event on Lamentis.

303
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,470
-你们都一心想着彼此呢  -莫比乌斯
- Both of you are swooning over each other. - Mobius.

304
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:10,980
-跟我说实话  -那可是天启
- Tell me the truth. - It's the apocalypse.

305
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:13,520
两个同一人的时间异体
Two Variants of the same being,

306
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,810
而且还是你  形成了这种病态
especially you, forming this kind of sick,

307
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:18,650
扭曲的浪漫关系
twisted romantic relationship.

308
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:21,330
那就是混乱  那可以破坏现实
That's pure chaos. That could break reality.

309
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,590
现在就破坏了我的现实
It's breaking my reality right now.

310
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,800
真是撼天动地的自恋狂
What a incredible seismic narcissist.

311
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,480
你爱上了自己
You fell for yourself.

312
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,130
她叫茜薇
Her name was Sylvie.

313
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,960
茜薇
Ah, Sylvie.

314
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,270
好听
Lovely.

315
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:38,210
怎么拼的  结尾是IE  还是就一个I
How do you spell that? Is that with an I-E or just an I?

316
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:39,590
她还活着吗
Is she alive?

317
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,630
暂时是的
For now.

318
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,950
渗透时管局
And was infiltrating the TVA,

319
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,130
一直就是你们的大计划吗
was that always sort of the grand plan?

320
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,740
我们的利益共通
Our interests are aligned.

321
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,960
推翻时间守护者吗
Overthrowing the Time-Keepers?

322
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:56,510
或许他们该被推翻
Maybe they need to be overthrown.

323
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:59,390
-我真该扇你  -莫比乌斯  听着
- I ought to box your ears. - Mobius, listen.

324
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:00,920
如果茜薇跟我说的
If what Sylvie told me about

325
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,240
关于这里的事是事实  对我们都有影响
this place is true, it affects all of us.

326
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,080
又来了  你这10分钟里
Here we go. Now, you've already

327
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,220
已经跟我说了50条谎言了
told me about 50 lies in the past 10 minutes.

328
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,640
-我这次没撒谎  -还要我相信
- I'm not lying this time. - Now, I'm supposed

329
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,770
-你的恐怖分子女朋友  -我说的是实话
- to believe your terrorist girlfriend. - I'm telling you the truth.

330
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:13,570
-她不是我女友  -随你怎么称呼她
- She's not my girlfriend. - Whatever you want to call her.

331
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:16,370
你疯狂迷恋的女版自我
What, your female self that you have some demented crush on...

332
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:18,180
你们都是时间异体
You're all Variants!

333
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,900
在时管局工作的每个人
Everyone who works at the TVA.

334
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,680
时间守护者没创造你们
The Time-Keepers didn't create you.

335
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,900
他们从时间线里绑架走了你们
They kidnapped you from the timeline,

336
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:27,140
并抹去了你们的记忆
and erased your memories.

337
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:32,420
而她凭魅术可以读取到这些记忆
Memories she can access through enchantment.

338
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:40,890
在这之前  你还有过去  甚至有家庭  人生
So before this, you had a past, maybe you had a family, a life.

339
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:51,910
真会编
Nice try.

340
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:57,980
真厉害  你们真是绝配
That was good. You two, what a pair!

341
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,220
天啊  难以置信  不管你们走到哪
Gosh! Unbelievable. Wherever you go,

342
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,620
都是死亡  毁灭
it's just death, destruction,

343
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:05,230
真正意义上的世界末日
the literal ends of worlds.

344
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:09,100
我得结案了
Well, I'm gonna have to close this case now,

345
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,820
因为我不需要你了
'cause I don't need you anymore.

346
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:15,050
或者按你的话说  我们的利益不共通了
Yeah, or as you might say, our interests are no longer aligned.

347
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,640
在这里的不计其数的
You know, of all the liars in this place,

348
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,970
骗子里  你是最大的骗子
and there are a great many, you're the biggest.

349
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,100
为什么  因为我在你女朋友的事上说谎了
Why? 'Cause I lied about your girlfriend?

350
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,870
不  我能尊重那个谎
Oh, no. That I can respect.

351
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:28,870
我是指你对自己说的谎
I mean, the lies you tell yourself.

352
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,360
开门
Open the door.

353
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:18,990
你好  我不知道
Hello... Oh, I don't know.

354
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:22,430
你的名字是数字  离这么远看不清
Your name's a number. Can't read it from here.

355
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,220
跟我来
Come with me.

356
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:53,020
莫比乌斯
Mobius?

357
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:55,260
嗯
Oh, yeah.

358
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:58,310
-你没事吧  -没事
- You okay? - Yep, I'm good.

359
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,650
-结案了  -是的
- Case closed. - Yes.

360
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:08,330
干杯
Cheers.

361
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,460
-干杯  -敬把这一切都抛诸身后
- Cheers. - To putting all this behind us.

362
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,770
阿门
Amen.

363
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:20,640
如果你可以去任何地点任何时间  你会去哪
If you could go anywhere, anytime, where would it be?

364
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,430
我本来就可以去任何地点任何时间
I can go anywhere, anytime.

365
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:23,540
你知道我的意思
You know what I mean.

366
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:30,610
你为什么不让我审问茜薇
Why wouldn't you let me interrogate Sylvie?

367
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:34,750
-茜薇  -那个时间异体  洛基是这么叫她的
- Sylvie? - The Variant, that's what Loki calls her.

368
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:37,600
你为什么不让我审问她
Why wouldn't you let me, you know, question her?

369
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:40,020
我说了  我们不能冒险再被她逃走
I told you, we couldn't risk her escaping again.

370
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,410
她肯定逃不走的
She wouldn't have escaped.

371
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:42,900
另一个时间异体
The other Variant got away

372
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,340
就在你第一次审问中途逃走了  不是吗
during your first interrogation, didn't he?

373
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:51,550
说吧  时间线上的任何地点和任何时间
Come on. Anywhere and anytime on the timeline.

374
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,460
你会去哪
Where'd you go?

375
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,090
我喜欢待在此时此地  和你一起工作
I like being here now, with you, doing the work.

376
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,450
行吧
Fine.

377
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:07,090
我收到了时间守护者的消息
I received word from the Time-Keepers.

378
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:10,050
他们想亲自监督那个时间异体的删除
They want to personally oversee the Variant's pruning.

379
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:13,100
他们还希望你到场
And they want you there, too.

380
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,240
可算啊  好极了
It's about time. Great.

381
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:23,740
你是什么时候开始注意到C20的异状的
When... When did you first notice what was going on with C-20?

382
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,560
莫比乌斯  你这是怎么了
Mobius, what is going on with you?

383
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,580
-没什么  -我们成功了
- Nothing. - We did it.

384
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,190
-我知道  -时间守护者很满意
- I know. - The Time-Keepers are happy.

385
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,540
-太棒了  -任务完成
- It's great. - Mission accomplished.

386
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:32,340
任务完成
Mission accomplished.

387
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:35,980
只是她本来看起来好好的
It was just that she seemed fine when I...

388
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:38,310
我看见她时  她虽然有点受惊  但并无大碍
When I saw her. I mean, a little freaked, but fine.

389
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:39,930
但她很快就不好了
Well, she quickly wasn't fine.

390
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,650
-好吧  -好的
- Okay. - Okay.

391
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,810
C20  那个时间异体
C-20? The Variant?

392
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,910
问一堆问题  你到底想说什么
All these questions, what are you getting at?

393
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,280
我不知道
I don't know. I...

394
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:52,400
有些事好像不太对劲
Something just seems a little off.

395
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:56,600
好吧  你想知道真相吗
Fine. You want the truth?

396
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,940
我是想保护你
I'm trying to protect you.

397
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:04,860
通常会由你来审问那样的人吗  是的
Would you normally interview someone like that? Yeah.

398
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:06,690
但那个时间异体把我吓坏了
But the Variant scares the hell out of me,

399
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:08,740
我不想看到你出事
and I didn't want to see anything happen to you.

400
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:12,570
C20疯了
C-20 lost her mind.

401
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:15,130
她最后连话都说不清楚
She couldn't even form words by the end.

402
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:20,700
我无法承受你或其他人变成那样
I just couldn't deal with that happening to you or anyone else.

403
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:23,090
这是你想听到的吗
Is that what you wanted to hear?

404
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:26,360
是的  如果这是真相
Yeah, if it's the truth.

405
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,920
你和那些洛基在一起太久了
You've been spending too much time with Lokis.

406
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,620
是啊
Yeah.

407
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:33,070
我绝对和那些洛基在一起太久了
I definitely have been spending too much time with Lokis.

408
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:35,330
我们的工作很重要
What we do here matters.

409
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:36,110
我知道
I know.

410
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:39,970
我们在外面为神圣时间线的命运而战时
When we're out there fighting for the fate of the Sacred Timeline

411
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:43,540
也是在为这个而战  为我们
we're also fighting for this. For us.

412
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:48,630
永恒的朋友  永远的盟友
Friends against time, allies to the end.

413
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:53,530
你见识过一切存在  和我一样  所以你知道
You've seen all of existence, same as me. So, you know,

414
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:59,610
我们之间的友谊非常罕有
friendship like ours is uncommon.

415
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,290
值得为之而战
And worth fighting for.

416
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:08,650
和神圣时间线一样
Same as the Sacred Timeline.

417
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:13,140
这番话很动人
It was a good speech.

418
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,150
谢谢
Thank you.

419
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:17,640
我就知道我是你最喜欢的分析师
I knew I was your favorite analyst.

420
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,370
有那么不好承认吗
Was that so hard to admit?

421
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:22,260
你要怎么处置那个战利品
What are you gonna do with that trophy?

422
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:23,950
打算放在哪
Where's that gonna go?

423
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:24,770
你说得对
You're right.

424
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,370
我想想
Let's see.

425
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,580
这里怎么样
How's that?

426
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,310
完美  你的柜子都快摆满了
Looks perfect. You're running out of room there.

427
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,420
好了  我们晚点见
All right, I will see you later on.

428
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:52,270
就喝一杯
One drink?

429
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:55,350
-我喝了双份  不是吗  -莫比乌斯
- I had two, didn't I? - Mobius!

430
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:58,670
这可是能让你晋升的案子  你确定你没事吗
This is a career case. You sure you're okay?

431
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:02,590
我就是很疲惫  应付那么多洛基
I'm just exhausted, dealing with all these Lokis.

432
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:06,810
也对
Fair enough.

433
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,950
我们了结此事吧
Let's finish this.

434
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,400
时时刻刻
For all time.

435
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:12,920
永永远远
Always.

436
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:16,240
楼上见  谢谢你的酒
I'll see you up there. Thanks for the drink.

437
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:29,980
好吧  你想要公平较量  我尊重你
Fine. You wanted a fair fight. I respect that.

438
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:33,130
你进入我大脑时  我看见了一些画面
When you were in my head, I saw something.

439
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:36,090
你对我做了什么
What did you do to me?

440
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,810
我让你看到了加入时管局之前的人生
I showed you your life before the TVA.

441
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:41,490
那是诡计  是骗术
That's a trick. It's a deception.

442
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:44,110
-不是的  -我是时间守护者创造出来的
- No, it's not. - I was created by the Time-Keepers.

443
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:47,430
不  我不能编造记忆
No. I can't create memories.

444
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:50,200
只能利用本来就存在的东西
I can only use what's already there.

445
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:54,150
时间守护者夺走了你们的人生
The Time-Keepers took your lives from you.

446
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,610
你们所有人
From all of you.

447
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,470
你们都是时间异体
You're Variants.

448
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,370
我们是一样的
We're the same.

449
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,730
让我看
Show me.

450
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:36,460
我看起来很快乐
I looked happy.

451
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:43,400
现在怎么办
What now?

452
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:36,780
你没听明白  我曾经到过那里
You're not hearing me. I was there.

453
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:40,510
我看到的画面是真的  我去过那个地方
This was real, what I saw. This is a place that I've been.

454
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:44,610
不是时管局的事  是一段记忆
This wasn't the TVA. This was a memory.

455
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:49,460
我在那里生活过  我去过那酒吧  我有过朋友
I lived down there. I went to that bar. I had friends.

456
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,910
我在神圣时间线上过得好好的
I had a whole life on the Sacred Timeline.

457
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,590
-冷静  -还"冷静"  我是时间异体
- Calm down. - "Calm down"? I'm a Variant.

458
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:58,190
你也是  这地方的每一个人都是
So are you. So is every single person in this place.

459
00:31:58,190 --> 00:31:59,380
到此为止吧
I'm ending this.

460
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:15,400
我听过一次  我听过一千次
I've heard it once, I've heard it a thousand times.

461
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,790
你  你个狡猾  懦弱  可悲的蠕虫
"You. You conniving, craven, pathetic worm.

462
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:20,020
这是你干的
You did this."

463
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:24,480
是不是
Right?

464
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:26,890
-你在干什么  -消磨时间
- What are you doing? - Passing the time.

465
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:28,110
你在乎这名时间异体吗
Do you care about this Variant?

466
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:29,950
茜薇吗  "在乎"这个词好像不太恰当
Sylvie? I'm not sure if "care" is the right word.

467
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:31,780
-我们在那里不是说过这个吗  -闭嘴
- I think we've covered this back in there. - Shut up!

468
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:35,310
你真觉得自己活该孤独一人吗
Do you really think you deserve to be alone?

469
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,840
-洛基  -是你让我闭嘴的
- Loki! - You told me to shut up.

470
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,890
你真相信自己活该孤独一人吗
Do you really believe you deserve to be alone?

471
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:42,010
-我不知道  -那你得快点想明白
- I don't know. - You better figure it out quick,

472
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:44,020
因为你俩引起的关联事件
because the nexus event the two of you caused,

473
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:47,160
不管是什么  都能摧毁这里
I think whatever that connection is, can bring this whole place down.

474
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,690
-所以我们最好理解...  -我们
- So we better understand... - "We"?

475
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,800
你发誓她没给追踪者C20植入那些记忆吗
Do you swear she didn't implant those memories in Hunter C-20?

476
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,520
莫比乌斯  她没有  我相信她
Mobius, no. I believe her.

477
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,770
那我就只能相信两个洛基的话咯
So, I just have to trust the word of two Lokis?

478
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:04,130
相信朋友的话  这样想好吗
How about the word of a friend?

479
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:11,450
关于时管局你说得对
You were right, about the TVA.

480
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:13,570
你从一开始就说对了
You were right from the beginning.

481
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:17,400
你要是想救她  你就得相信我
And if you wanna save her, you need to trust me.

482
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:18,500
做得到吗
Can we do that?

483
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:21,290
-能  -好
- Yes. - Okay.

484
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:26,170
你想变成谁都行  想变成什么都行
You could be whoever, whatever you wanna be,

485
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,500
哪怕变成好人
even someone good.

486
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:32,000
如果别人跟你说过不一样的话  别信
I mean, just in case anyone ever told you different.

487
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,500
你拿了我的东西吧
I think you have something of mine.

488
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,790
是啊  我都下来了
Yeah, I got all the way down there

489
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:51,190
才发现我错拿了你的
before I even realized I picked up yours.

490
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:54,840
怎么了
What's going on?

491
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,160
出什么事了  萝雯娜
What's the problem, Ravonna?

492
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:11,040
如果我去哪里都可以  你知道我会去哪吗
You know where I'd go if I could go anywhere?

493
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,940
去我真正的家乡
Wherever it is I'm really from.

494
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,320
在时管局来之前  我生活的地方
Yeah, wherever I had a life before the TVA came along.

495
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:20,530
也许我有过摩托艇
Maybe I had a jet ski.

496
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,490
这才是我想做的事
That's what I'd like to do.

497
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:26,300
-驾着摩托艇到处逍遥  -删除他
- Just riding around on my jet ski. - Prune him.

498
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:44,010
到电梯那里等我
Wait for me at the elevator.

499
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:24,680
谁来过她这里
Who was in here with her?

500
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:27,010
抱歉  长官  B15坚持要来
Sorry, ma'am, B-15 insisted.

501
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,670
通缉追踪者B15
Put out an alert for Hunter B-15.

502
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,640
她也被时间异体蛊惑了
She too has been compromised by the Variant.

503
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,130
你还好吗
You okay?

504
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,210
接下来他俩就交给我吧
I've got them from here.

505
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:33,560
你记得我吗
Do you remember me?

506
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,060
记得
I do.

507
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,940
你想跟我说什么  时间异体
What do you wanna say to me, Variant?

508
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:45,040
我的关联事件是什么
What was my nexus event?

509
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:47,420
为什么抓我
Why did you bring me in?

510
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:50,340
有什么关系呢
What does it matter?

511
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:56,390
足以夺走我的生活  导致这一切发生
It was enough to take my life from me, lead to all of this.

512
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:58,520
肯定很重要
Must have been important.

513
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:01,370
什么事
So, what was it?

514
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:07,900
我不记得了
I don't remember.

515
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:33,770
仁慈的时间守护者
Gracious Time-Keepers,

516
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:38,330
我们说好的  我带时间异体来了
as promised, the Variants.

517
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:41,610
你们再怎么挣扎
After all your struggle,

518
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:45,130
最后还是来到了我们面前
at last, you've arrived before us.

519
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:49,300
你们临死之前
What do you have to say for yourselves

520
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:52,290
还有什么想为自己辩护的  时间异体
before you meet your end, Variants?

521
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:54,840
你们就为了这个才带我们过来吗
Is that the only reason you brought us here?

522
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:57,450
为了杀掉我们
To kill us?

523
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:02,360
我已经不记得我被杀过多少次了  来吧
I've lost track of the number of times I've been killed, so go ahead.

524
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,160
尽管来吧
Do your worst.

525
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:10,540
你和你的虚张声势威胁不到我们  时间异体
You and your bravado are no threat to us, Variant.

526
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:13,020
不  我觉得你这话不是真心的
Oh, no, I don't think you believe that.

527
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,500
我觉得
I think...

528
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,490
我觉得你们吓坏了
I think you're scared.

529
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:26,120
不  时间异体  你不过是个大大的失望
No, Variant. You're nothing but a cosmic disappointment.

530
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,230
-删除他们  -不  我跟你还没完
- Delete them. - No, I'm not done with you yet.

531
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:40,790
时时刻刻
For all time.

532
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,200
永永远远
Always.

533
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:51,280
保护时间守护者
Protect the Time-Keepers!

534
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:02,190
帮我一把
A little help here?

535
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:05,120
接着
Here.

536
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:08,300
来
Come on.

537
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,810
这次我要完成任务
This time I finish the job.

538
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:01,870
你也是时间守护者的孩子  茜薇
You're a child of the Time-Keepers too, Sylvie.

539
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:04,010
-我们可以谈谈  -是吗
- We can talk. - Oh, yeah?

540
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,400
等等
Wait.

541
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:25,540
别
Don't.

542
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:32,670
是假的
Fake.

543
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:37,910
无意识的机器人
Mindless androids.

544
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:44,220
它不休不眠
It never stops.

545
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:52,880
那是谁创造了时管局
Then who created the TVA?

546
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:55,760
我还以为到此为止了
